New concepts learnt:
1.SCSS:
upgraded version of css
2.need npm installation for this
npm install -g sass
then we convert the .scss file to css with the below command
sass --watch style.scss style.css
--
@mixin header name
{

}
is like a function that can be invoked anyhere like
h4
{
    @include header name
}
and instead of 
article:hover
{

}, we can use like
article{
    &:hover{

    }
}
